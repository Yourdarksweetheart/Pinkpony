        <h2>First post</h2>
        <p class="today"> Today I cried a lot, because I wasn't able to talk to anybody about myself, about my stuff going on in my life.
            <br>
             I really hope to talk to someone that can give me some useful advice on how to take the next step in my life. 
                <br>
               I want to seek help from others who understand my position.

        <p>Something really bad happened.</p>
        
    <h2> Second Post</h2> 
    <p class="hate-family">I hate my family for many reasons.
        <br> For starters, I hate them to be so poor and I have to endure this.
